# Interfaces

Interface is like a contract
No real logic within {}
Instead, a little more abstract
Lays down terms for what any implementation would adhere to 
Are there things that they all share in common?
When you implement an interface, PHP forces you to adhere to the methods within the interface.
PROGRAM TO AN INTERFACE, NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION
If there are ever classes or tasks where you can imagine having multiple implementations for executing task/behavior, it is a telltale sign for an interface.
